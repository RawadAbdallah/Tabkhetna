<!-- Prototyping -->

> I designed Tabkhetna using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

### Tabkhetna is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the MERN stack. The MERN stack is a full-stack JavaScript solution, comprising MongoDB as the database, Express.js as the web application framework, React as the front-end library, and Node.js as the server runtime. The MERN stack enables the development of cross-platform applications with a unified codebase for mobile, desktop, and web environments.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the MongoDB database. MongoDB allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database, providing a flexible and scalable solution for data management.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
